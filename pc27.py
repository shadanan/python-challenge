# It's a photograph of a lake with mountains in the background.
# An oar is tracing a zigzag on the image.
# The title of the page is "between the tables".
# The photograph links to "../ring/bell.html" which asks for a username and password.
# The image is called zigzag.jpg but there's a comment that says "did you say gif?"
# There's a hint, "oh, and this is NOT a repeat of 14"

# In level 14, we changed the position of pixels to produce an image. The hint suggests
# that we should have to do something different.
